# hello-world-
A mathematician and an engineer are given a challenge. They 
are placed 100 meters from a bag of gold, and are told that everytime 
a light blinks, they can half the distance between them
and the gold. The mathematician becomes frustrated and stomps 
away, knowing that it will be impossible for them to get to the 
100 meters by only halving their distance. 
The mathematician turns around and sees that the engineer is 
still standing and waiting for the light blinks. Surprised, he says,
"You must know that it is impossible to get to the bag." The engineer 
turns around and says, "I know. But eventually we will be able
to reach it."
